## Introduction
## Scope of Work
## Executive Summary

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
munis2 %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(-(geometry)) %>%
  select("Name", ihprops) %>%
  arrange(Name) %>%
  kable(caption = "Inviitation Homes, by SFR", #, escape = F, booktabs =T,
        # format.args = list(big.mark = ",", scientic = FALSE),
        col.names = c("Municipality",
                      "INVH SFRs"))
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
